## Background

The following table contains code systems an/or value sets have been modified or created for Signal. 
- An attempt was made to use a standards-based, [external code systems](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/terminologies-systems.html#external) whenever possible; e.g. ICD-10, LOINC, SNOMED, CPT, etc. to retain interoperability.
- When possible, the original FHIR or US Core valueset binding was included in a custom ValueSet in order to maintain integrity and both codes may be used. 
- Any custom values will be defined in a CodeSystem resource in addition to the ValueSet.

## Signal custom value sets defined by this implementation guide
