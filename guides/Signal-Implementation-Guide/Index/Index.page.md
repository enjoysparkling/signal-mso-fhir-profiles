# Signal Implementation Guide

This implementation guide (IG) is provided to support the use of FHIR®️©️ with a Signal context. This IG is based on the US Core version 6.0.0 ([hl7.fhir.us.core 6.0.0](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6/)) which, in turn, is based on FHIR core Version R4 ([hl7.fhir.r4.core 4.0.1](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4)).

[Signal](https://signalbhn.org/) is a Managed Service Organization (MSO) for 37 counties in Colorado, Signal strives to foster a high-quality, equitable, and affordable network of services for Coloradans struggling with substance use disorder or in crisis.

This implementation is intended to comply with data collection and reporting needs of [Colorado Behavioral Health Administration (BHA)](https://bha.colorado.gov/)
