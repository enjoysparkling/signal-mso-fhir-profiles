# Profile usage

The Organization resource is used to collect information on healthcare service providers, provider locations, or service organizations that may be used as support for other resources that need to reference organizations.  Hierarchies (levels via Organization.partOf), affiliations (via the OrganizationAffliation resource), and services (via the HealthcareServices resource) are established to provide context into relationships and capabilities of each organization.

## Profile element notes

**.identifier**
- Business identifier(s) specific to this resource
- Identifier corresponding to slices below **SHALL** utilize those slices
- Identifiers corresponding to clinicians/practitioners SHOULD be included on Practitioner resource
- MAY contain identifiers from external systems
- Slices:
   - **identifier:NPI** - National Provider Identifier (NPI)
      - Required for Signal
      - Should match to the NPI Taxonomy registered with CMS
   - **identifier:CLIA** - Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Number for laboratories
   - **identifier:NAIC** - NAIC Code

**.identifier.system**
 - The namespace for the identifier value (i.e., the “source identifier issuer system”), where the value must be unique within the system.

**.identifier.value**
- SHOULD contain a unique value for the identifier within its system
- Master Record identifiers (generated by a Master Record Holder, MRH) SHALL use UUIDs or some other globally unique naming convention.

**.identifier.assigner**
- MAY contain a reference to the organization issuing the identifier
- MAY contain only a string of text

**.name**
- SHOULD contain the name of the organization presented to providers and users, e.g., "Denver Medical"


**.type**
- Signal custom code system that identifies the kind of organization (e.g. service organization, provider agency, provider location)
- Type does not explicitly denote hierarchy. The `.partOf` and the *OrganizationAffiliation* resource should be used for this purpose.
- Binding: [SignalOrganizationType](https://simplifier.net/resolve?scope=Signal-MSO-FHIR-Profiles@current&filepath=input/vocabulary/valueset-organization-type.json) (required)
Slices:
   - **.type:npiTaxonomy** - Signal Custom slice representing NPI Provider Taxonomy Code
      - Binding: [ProviderTaxonomyCodes](https://simplifier.net/resolve?scope=Signal-MSO-FHIR-Profiles@current&filepath=input/vocabulary/valueset-provider-taxonomy.json) (required)

**.partOf**
- The organization of which this organization forms a part
- Provider locations are part of an Provider/State Agency
- Most common example is the specific *provider location* for a *provider agency*;  e.g. 'Denver West' provider location would contain `.partOf='Denver Medical'`
- This relationship will be used for determining user access to services associated with Patients at the provider agency

**.qualification (extension)**
- This should represent the same as the `Organization.qualification` element now included in [Organization (R5)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/organization.html)
- Signal custom code system and valueset that identifies services (licenses) a provider is qualified to offer
   - Binding: [valueset-organization-license-type.json](https://simplifier.net/resolve?scope=Signal-MSO-FHIR-Profiles@current&filepath=input/vocabulary/valueset-organization-license-type.json) (required)

**.photo (extension)**
- Used to store Organization logo for use in the user interface (UI)
- Logo will be placed in storage and URI provided for the file
