## Profile usage

The Organization resource is used to collect information on healthcare service providers, provider locations, or service organizations that may be used as support for other resources that need to reference organizations.  Hierarchies (levels via Organization.partOf), affiliations (via the OrganizationAffliation resource), and services (via the HealthcareServices resource) are established to provide context into relationships and capabilities of each organization.

### Profile element notes

**.identifier**
- Business identifier(s) specific to this resource
- Identifier corresponding to slices below **SHALL** utilize those slices
- Identifiers corresponding to clinicians/practitioners SHOULD be included on Practitioner resource
- MAY contain identifiers from external systems
- Slices:
   - **identifier:NPI** - National Provider Identifier (NPI)
      - Required for Signal
      - SHOULD match to the NPI Taxonomy registered with CMS which SHOULD be included on `.type:npiTaxonomy`
   - **identifier:CLIA** - Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Number for laboratories
   - **identifier:NAIC** - NAIC Code

**.identifier.system**
 - The namespace for the identifier value (i.e., the “source identifier issuer system”), where the value must be unique within the system.

**.identifier.value**
- SHOULD contain a unique value for the identifier within its system
- Master Record identifiers (generated by a Master Record Holder, MRH) SHALL use UUIDs or some other globally unique naming convention.

**.identifier.assigner**
- MAY contain a reference to the organization issuing the identifier
- MAY contain only a string of text

**.name**
- SHOULD contain the name of the organization presented to providers and users, e.g., "Denver Medical"

**.type**
- Cstom code system that identifies the kind of organization (e.g. service organization, provider agency, provider location)
- Does not explicitly denote hierarchy. See the `.partOf` element and the *OrganizationAffiliation* resource for more information.
Slices:
   - **.type:npiTaxonomy** - representing NPI Provider Taxonomy Code (from CMS)

**.partOf**
- SHALL reference an existing Organization resource when used
- The organization that wholly or partly owns the current organization; e.g. Provider locations are part of an Provider/State Agency
- Most common example is the specific *provider location* for a *provider agency*;  e.g. 'Denver West' provider location would contain `.partOf='Denver Medical'`
- This relationship will be used for determining user access to services associated with Patients at the provider agency

**.extension:qualification**
- Represents the same purpose as the `Organization.qualification` element now included in [Organization (R5)](https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/organization.html)
- Signal custom code system and valueset that identifies services (licenses) a provider is qualified to offer.  
   - Licenses are assigned by [Colorado LADDERS](https://www.colorado.gov/LADDERS)
- Qualification address SHALL match the `.address` field

**.extension:photo**
- Used to store Organization logo for use in the user interface (UI)
- Logo will be placed in storage and URI provided for the file, so use the “.url” not “.data” field, to prevent search API filesizes from being too large.
- File size and type constraints to be applied by implementation partners
- Restricted to “safe” data types
   - Images: jpeg, jpg, png, gif, ico

**.addresss**
- SHOULD contain information about the physical location of this organization. 
- SHALL match the location on licenses (defined in `extension:qualification`).
