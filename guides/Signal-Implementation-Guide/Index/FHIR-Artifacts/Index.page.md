Most profiles are derived from [US Core](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/index.html) or [FHIR Core R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/resourcelist.html), which contains detailed background: 
> A simple narrative summary gives each profileâ€™s requirements and guidance. A formal hierarchical table presents a [logical view](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/formats.html#table) of the content in both a differential and snapshot view and references to appropriate terminologies and examples are provided.

Review [US Core Must Support](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/must-support.html) for definitions on mandetory elements and requirements.  These must also be supported in this IG for any profiles used from US Core.

All Signal-specific fields added are also defined as *key elements*. See [FHIR IG Guidance Structure Definitions](https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/ig-guidance/readingIgs.html#structure-definitions) for more information.

**Formal profile content**

Tree structure of profile that is available as: 
- Snapshot - includes all elements and descriptions
- Tree, diff/hybrid/snapshot - selectable, combined view of all options include diff (differences from base canonical URL from which the profile was derived), hybrid (differences highlighted), snapshot
- JSON - shows JSON differences from base definition canonical URL

Tip:  To highlight institution-specific changes from base definition canonical URL, choose the `diff` tree type.

**Profile useage**
Will describe implementation-specific usage and key elements with notes.
