Resources are based on the [US Core Implementation Guide STU 6](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/STU6/index.html). When resources are not available or not appropriate for business context from the US Core [FHIR Core R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html) modules will be used.

FHIR resources have been arranged in modules to form the business context for this Implementation Guide (IG).  The following modules are available:
- {{pagelink:Index/Business-Context/Organization-Services-Module.page.md}}
- {{pagelink:Index/Business-Context/Clinical-Categorization-Module.page.md}}
- [Finance Module](#)

Modifications or particular implementation elements that vary or require explanation beyond the US Core or FHIR Core will be documented in this IG.
